# Weekend Homework - HTML & CSS Pre-reading

## Brief

We've spent the last 2 weeks practising programming fundamentals with Python. Next week we'll start learning how to use those skills to build web applications, using Python to create web servers. This means we'll need to add a few new tools to our toolbelts, two of those being HTML & CSS.

Your homework this weekend is to work through the enclosed HTML and CSS content. This will set the foundation for next week, when we'll build on this knowledge and learn how to use these technologies in combination with Python.
