## Introduction

CSS3 is the currently used version of CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets. CSS is the code which browsers use to alter the cosmetics and the layout of content rendered on a web page.

Like HTML, CSS is used in almost every web page you'll have ever visited. In this lesson you will learn the commonly used ways to select HTML elements to style in CSS, as well as some of the commonly used CSS properties used when changing the cosmetics of a web page.

Today we will learn how to add some cosmetic styling to a web page. This will enable us to make our web apps attractive to the user and more intuitive to use.

Open the start code and take a few minutes to read and understand the structure of the HTML.

## Styling with CSS

In this lesson we are going to use CSS to style the elements within the index.html contained in the start code. To do this, the first thing that we have to do is create a CSS file and reference it from within our HTML file.

```sh
# Terminal

touch style.css
```

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<head>
  <!-- ... -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css"> <!-- NEW -->
</head>
```

Now, after the HTML file is loaded in our browser it will go and get the CSS file that we have referenced and apply the styling rules contained within it. Currently, the file is empty so the page won't look any different.

Let's add some styling rules.

In order to style an HTML element, we first have to target it using a CSS selector, then we can define a set of rules that will be applied to any elements that will be targetted by that selector.

First, let's change the font. To do this we can target the `<body>` and set a rule for its `font-family` property. This rule will cascade downwards and affect all children of `<body>` too. When setting a font, it's good practice to specify fallback fonts, in case the font that we want to use isn't available for some reason.

```css
/* style.css */

body {                                       /* NEW */
  font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif; /* NEW */
}                                            /* NEW */
```

This will tell the browser to attempt to use Helvetica, if Helvetica isn't available then the browser will try to use Arial, finally if neither Helvetica or Arial are available, the browser will use the operating system's default sans-serif font.

> Note: If the name of the font includes a space then the name must be wrapped in quotes, e.g. "Lucida Grande"

Next, we will style the footer of the web page. Let's add a background color so that it stands out from the rest of the page.

Our first instict might be to select `<footer>` elements, but we'll run into a problem if we do.

```css
footer {                        /* NEW */
  background-color: dodgerblue; /* NEW */
}                               /* NEW */
```

This applies the background colour too ALL `<footer>` elements on the page, which isn't exactly what we want. We only want to style the main footer at the bottom of the page. We have a few options here. We could add an `id`, allowing us to target the element directly, but it's best to avoid littering our HTML with unecessary classes and ids where possible. Instead, we will apply this rule to all `<footer>`s that are direct children of the `<body>`. We can do this using the `>` selector.

```css
body > footer { /* UPDATED */
  background-color: dodgerblue;
}
```

You'll notice that our footer doesn't extend all the way to the edges of the page. This is because there is some margin on the body that pushes everything away from the edges of the window. We can remove this margin, which will cause elements such as the page's header and footer to extend all the way to the edge of the window.

```css
body {
  margin: 0; /* NEW */
  font-family: Helvetica, Arial, sans-serif;
}
```

The blue background on the `<footer>` is also quite tight around the text. We can use `padding` to create more space within the element. While we're there, we can also change the colour of the text to white and align it in the centre of the element.

```css
/* ... */

body > footer > p {   /* NEW */
  padding: 16px;      /* NEW */
  color: white;       /* NEW */
  text-align: center; /* NEW */
}
```

Note that margin creates space around the element, whle padding creates space within the element.

Next we will style the header similarly to the footer. We can use a similar approach that we used to style the footer. The element that we want to style is a `<header>`, but it isn't the only `<header>` element on the page. We specifically want to style the `<header>` element that is a direct child of the `<body>`.

```css
body > header {                 /* NEW */
  background-color: dodgerblue; /* NEW */
  color: white;                 /* NEW */
}                               /* NEW */
```

Our web page is starting to take shape, but the header doesn't look quite right. There's some margin pushing it down from the top of the page and the links haven't taken the white font colour that we wanted.

We can use the "select element" feature of Chrome's devtools to figure out where the margin is coming from.

Open Chrome's devtools using `Option + âŒ˜ + J` and select the "select element" tool by clicking on the mouse cursor icon in the top left. You can use this tool to hover over elements, highlighting them and displaying their margin and padding.

Using Chrome's devtools we should be able to see that the margin is coming from the `<h1>` element within the header. We could select this `<h1>` element by selecting h1 elements which are children of a header which is a child of the body. We may also wish to apply a specific font to the logo of our site, whether that's in the header or elsewhere though, so we'll use an id.

First, let's add an id to the HTML.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<header>
  <h1 id="logo">CSS</h1> <!-- UPDATED -->
  <!-- ... -->
</header>
```

Now we can use this id to select this h1 from within our CSS and remove the margin from this element. We can use the `#` selector to select an element by id.

```css
/* style.css */

#logo {      /* NEW */
  margin: 0; /* NEW */
}            /* NEW */
```

Next we will change the `font-family` of our logo, so that it uses a custom font from [Google fonts](https://fonts.google.com/). Navigate to Google fonts and choose a font that you would like to use. We will then need to reference it from our HTML to load it, because the user likely won't have the font installed.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<head>
  <!-- ... -->
  <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Fredoka+One&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
</head>
```

Just like our stylesheet, the browser will now load our custom font when it loads our HTML file. Now that we have loaded the font, we can use it to set the `font-family` of our logo. Remember to wrap the name of your font in quotes if it contains a space and supply a fallback font in case the font can't be loaded for some reason.

```css
#logo {                                   /* NEW */
  margin: 0;                              /* NEW */
  font-family: "Fredoka One", sans-serif; /* NEW */
}                                         /* NEW */
```

We won't worry about positioning the elements inside of our header today. That will become much easier using some tools that we will learn later. But we will do a little bit more styling.

Let's remove the bullet points from the list of links and also make them white, as blue on blue isn't particularly easy to read.

```css
nav > ul {          /* NEW */
  list-style: none; /* NEW */
}                   /* NEW */

nav > ul > li > a {      /* NEW */
  color: white;     /* NEW */
}                   /* NEW */
```

Now things are really starting to take shape. The main content looks a bit strange as it spans the whole page. It might be easier to read if it were more restricted to the centre of the page. We can do this by setting the width of the `<article>` that contains the content.

```css
body > main > article { /* NEW */
  width: 70%;           /* NEW */
}                       /* NEW */
```

Note that it's always better to use a relative value when possible. Absolute values (px, for example) should only be used for things like margin, padding or, in some cases, images.

This looks a little better, but it would be nice if our content sat in the middle of the page, rather than the left-hand side. We can achieve this by setting the `margin` property of this element to `auto`. This will apply a horizontal margin that fills the rest of the vertical space that is not occupied by the article.

```css
body > main > article { /* NEW */
  margin: auto;         /* NEW */
  width: 70%;           /* NEW */
}                       /* NEW */
```

Great, this almost looks like an actual website, save for some dodgy positioning that we'll learn how to deal with later.

The last thing that we're going to do in this lesson is style the like and share buttons at the bottom of the article. We will give these CSS classes, to make them easy to access. A page may contain many articles, each with their own like and share buttons, and we would want to make sure that they were all styled the same way.

```html
<!-- index.html -->

<footer>
  <button class="like-button">Like</button>   <!-- UPDATED -->
  <button class="share-button">Share</button> <!-- UPDATED -->
</footer>
```

To select an HTML element via its class we can use the `.` selector followed by the name of the class in our CSS file.

For now, we will just remove the grey background and change the colour of the borders.

```css
.like-button {                   /* NEW */
  background-color: transparent; /* NEW */
  border: 1px solid dodgerblue;  /* NEW */
}                                /* NEW */

.share-button {                  /* NEW */
  background-color: transparent; /* NEW */
  border: 1px solid green;       /* NEW */
}                                /* NEW */
```

## Recap

<details>
<summary>What syntax is used to select an HTML element using its class(es)?</summary>

The `.` is used before the classname (`.classname`).
</details>

<details>
<summary>What syntax is used to select an HTML element using its id?</summary>

The `#` is used before the id (`#id`).
</details>

<details>
<summary>
What syntax is used to select an HTML element that is a direct child of another element?
</summary>

The `>` is used between the parent and child (`body > main`).
</details>

<details>
<summary>
Why is it important to provide a fallback font?
</summary>

A fallback font allows us to ensure that our web page looks somewhat similar to the intended aesthetic, even if the fonts fail to load for some reason.

## Conclusion

CSS at its core is very simple. Select an element that you would like to style, and apply some rules to it. Like most other technologies, the hard part is learning to use it well. In this lesson we covered some of the best practices when using CSS to change the appearance of a web page. Once we're comfortable with this we will be in an excellent position to learn some of the more advanced CSS features that can be used to position elements on a page.
