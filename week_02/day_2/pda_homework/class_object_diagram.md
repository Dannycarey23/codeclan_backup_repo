# PDA Homework - Class & Object Diagram

For the Personal Development Award (PDA) you are required to demonstrate your understanding of certain software design topics by collecting evidence (often diagram based) and writing about them.

The following two assignments are under the category of **Analysis & Design (A.D.)**:


## A.D.2 - Class Diagram

Include in your screenshot:

* A class diagram

The class diagram must contain:

* At least two classes contained in rectangles with the title of the class at the top (capitalised)
* At least one attribute for each class with types indicated (e.g. “name: string”, “age: int”)
* Any methods that each class has
* Lines or "relationships" to indicate the structure of the classes and how they interact with each other. Types of relationships, such as many-to-many, do not need to be indicated at this level

Submit a comment explaining your understanding of:

* The class diagram you’ve submitted and its use
* Design decisions made when producing the diagram


## A.D.3 - Object Diagram

Include in your screenshot:

* An object diagram

The object diagram must contain:

* At least two objects contained in rectangles with the title of the Class being used at the top (Capitalised). This should also have the specific object title (e.g. for a class titled "Member", the object diagram would be titled "Alex: Member")
* At least one attribute for each object with objects indicated (e.g. “name: Alex”, “age: 32”)
* Lines or "relationships" to indicate the structure of the classes and how they interact with each other. Types of relationships, such as many-to-many, do not need to be indicated at this level

Submit a comment explaining your understanding of:

* The object diagrams you’ve submitted and their use
* Design decisions made when producing the diagram


Remember:

* Attach examples as image files or screenshots (when we start using the Canvas app)
* Use original work that is your own (i.e. no examples handed out as course materials, copied from the internet, or submitted by another student)
* Reattach all files on any resubmission (when we start using the Canvas app)
* Do NOT reuse examples from another submission
