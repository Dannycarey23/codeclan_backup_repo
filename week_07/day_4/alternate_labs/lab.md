# React Practice

Today, we're going to consolidate everything we've done in React so far. You can choose from the following mini-projects.

## Mortgage Calculator

Build a simple mortgage affordability calculator, which takes in a person's salary (and optionally, their partner's salary). Display the maximum value of the property that the person or couple can afford. (Use a simple calculation of `combined salary * 3` to begin with).

Choose this project if you want to practice:

- Components, state (`useState`), props and `useEffect`.
- Business logic
- Controlled form components

As an extension, you can add more fields - and therefore complexity - to the calculation. For example:

- Add a deposit field, which is added on to the maximum value of the property
- Add a field for "other monthly commitments", which should reduce the maximum possible value

As an advanced extension:

- Allow the user to enter the interest rate of the mortgage, and the length of the mortgage term in years. Output their monthly repayments.

_*Hint:*_ Think about where the calculations are going to be performed. Plan your work carefully.


## Metronome

You have been asked to create a [metronome](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=metronome&oq=metronome&aqs=chrome..69i57j0l5.1319j0j1&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8), much like the one that Google provides. Start with a range slider, play and stop buttons.

Choose this project if you want to practice:

- - Components, state (`useState`), props and `useEffect`.
- Working with intervals
- Working with sound
- Researching topics you're not familiar with

As an extension, you could:

- Allow the user to select different sounds from a list.

_*Hint:*_ You might want to research the [range](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/range) input type, [setInterval](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/setInterval), [clearInterval](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/clearInterval), and [making sound with JavaScript](https://stackoverflow.com/a/23395136/22946).
