# All Day Lab

There are two options for the all day lab - countries_lab and alternate_labs. The countries lab is simpler and allows students to focus on the fundamentals, while the alternate labs are a bit more challenging and allow students to explore new concepts or work with more challenging logic.

You can decide for yourself which you feel will benefit your cohort more, or you might give out both labs and allow students to decide for themselves which they would prefer.
