# Lab: Make an app with the Countries API

## Learning Objectives
- Be able to make requests and displaying the data in the page
- Understand how to traverse the data structure received from an API
- Be able to implement React `useState` and `useEffect` hooks

Your task is to build an app that uses [this API](https://restcountries.com/v3.1/all) to display information on the countries of the world :earth_africa:

## MVP

Your app should be able to:
- Display the total population of all the countries the API provides.
- Allow the user to select a single country and display information about it (at least the country's name and 1 other attribute).
- Allow users to add their favourite countries to a list that is also displayed in your app.

## Extensions

- Show a list of the selected country's neighbouring countries.
- Display the total population of these neighbouring countries.
- Prevent the same country being added to the user's favourite countries list twice.
- Diplays the countries flag (from the flags field, not the icon) next to its name
