# Lab - Research

This lab is going to give you the opportunity to do some research on a topic and present to your classmates.

Each pair/group will be asked to do some research on a topic and then give a 5(ish) minute presentation to the rest of the class, based on what they have learned in their research. 

You have a choice of topics to research. Decide in your group which you want to research and present on.

## The Choices:

### 1) Design Patterns

We've looked at the Singleton design pattern, and you've already seen the Strategy pattern. 
Below is a list of some of other most commonly used design patterns:

- Factory Pattern
- Observer Pattern
- Builder Pattern
- Adapter Pattern
- State Pattern
- Template Method Pattern

Your task is to select one of these patterns, go and do some research on that pattern, and present your findings to the rest of the class. 

### 2) Java Stream Operations

We have had an introduction to how streams work in Java, and seen some of the operations we can perform on them. 

Below is a list of other Java stream operations:

#### Intermediate Operations
 - `flatMap()`
 - `distinct()`
 - `limit()`
 - `peek()`
 
#### Terminal Operations
 - `anyMatch()`
 - `allMatch()`
 - `noneMatch()`
 - `count()`
 - `findAny()`
 - `min()`
 - `toArray()`

Your task is to choose a couple of the operations which you think look interesting and go and research what those operations do and present what you discover to the class, perhaps using a coding example.

## Finding Information
 
There are lots of resources on the web for both topics.  Feel free to use information from more than one website - this is a good sign that you can research for information and collate it.
