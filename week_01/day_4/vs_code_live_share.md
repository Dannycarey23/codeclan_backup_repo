# VS Code Live Share

**Lesson Duration: 10 minutes**

### Learning Objectives

- Be able to use VS Code Live Share

## Introduction

Collaboration is very important in software development. This can be difficult in the modern world, in which working remotely is becoming increasingly common. Whether you're directly working with another developer to produce code (pair programming), getting some help to debug an issue, or helping someone else, it's important to have tools that allow us to work remotely with other developers.

Most text editors that are designed for writing code offer some kind of tool that allows for real-time collaboration. We will be using the text editor VS Code which has a feature called Live Share that allows us to create a session and invite other people to read or edit the code that we are currently working on in real-time.

## Creating a Session

Start by opening VS Code.

Once VS Code is open, you should see a Live Share button at the bottom of the screen. When you click this button, you will be prompted to log in with either your Microsoft or GitHub account. After you log in, or if you were already logged in, you will see a button with your name on it at the bottom of the screen. Clicking on this button will allow you to create a Live Share session and invite others to join you.

Click on your name and then "invite others (copy link)". You will now be able to send this link to others and have them join your session.

## Conclusion

VS Code's Live Share feature is incredibly useful for working on code with other people or getting help when you get stuck. Learning to use it will be essential, so remember it's there!
